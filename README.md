                                           UI (User Interface): 

UI refers to the elements that the user interacts with directly. In this case, the UI includes

User Enters Email and Password when dalta hai  (Frontend)

The user sees a login form in the UI where they enter their email and password.
This form is part of the frontend.
When the user clicks the "Login" button, the frontend (using JavaScript or AJAX) sends the entered email and password to the backend for verification.
 When the user logs in later, the frontend will send a request to the backend to verify their credentials, fetch their profile, and load the relevant data.
                                                Backend:

The Backend is the server-side logic that powers the website behind the scenes. It is responsible for:

Handling User Requests: When you enter your email and password to log in, the backend verifies these credentials by querying the database.
Data Processing: The market cap and other crypto data displayed on the charts are fetched from various data sources or APIs. The backend processes this data before sending it to the frontend to display.
Security: The backend ensures data security, including encryption of login credentials and API keys to fetch data from external services.  

                                                 Database: 
 The Database is where all the information is stored. In this case, the database might store:

User Accounts: Information such as emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords.
Market Data: All the data about cryptocurrencies, exchanges, trading volumes, and market caps are stored in a database.
Historical Data: To generate charts, the website likely stores historical market data that the frontend can retrieve and visualize for users.
The backend retrieves this data from the database and sends it to the frontend, which then displays it to users.
